Where the shared resources live, which is not the same question as where an
environment lives.

The registry and its resource group are shared by every environment, so they
cannot follow a per-environment location. Production moved to East US 2 and
this parameter did not, because a resource cannot change region: pointing the
shared registry at a new one fails with InvalidResourceLocation and takes the
whole deployment with it, at stage 1, before anything environment-specific has
been looked at.

Changing this means creating a second registry under a different name and
repointing every environment at it. It is not a knob to turn casually.
