// cross-site fetch. So every API call is relayed by Vercel, and Vercel serves
// this project from iad1, in northern Virginia. Central US is Iowa, which made
// the relay a cross-country round trip on every single request.
//
// East US 2 is the same metropolitan area as iad1, so that hop stops being a
// hop worth measuring. It is also where the people using this are: Maryland,
// and the schools around it.
//
// Postgres is cheaper here too -- B1ms is $0.017/hour against $0.01921 in
// Central US -- and Container Apps is priced identically. Staging stays in
// Central US for now; it is moving subscriptions separately and should be
// created here when it does.
