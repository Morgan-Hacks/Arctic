/// Atlas does not send mail. Queueing is a row insert that takes a millisecond
/// and cannot fail because a provider is having a bad afternoon, whereas
/// sending inline would put SES's availability directly in the path of
/// somebody clicking "sign in".
/// <para>
/// It also means a login link goes through the same suppression check,
/// retry schedule and bounce handling as everything else. The stub this
/// replaced skipped all three, and would happily have mailed an address that
/// already hard-bounced.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This calls lark's own API rather than writing <c>notify.*</c> from here.
/// Modules talk through their published surface; the schema stays lark's, and
/// if lark ever moves to its own database only this class changes.
