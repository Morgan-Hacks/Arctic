/// <summary>
/// The questions a new application form starts out with.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A starting point and nothing more. Nothing here is enforced after the draft
/// is created: the registration team may reword any of it, reorder it, or take
/// it off the form entirely, and neither a save nor a publish will argue. What
/// this buys is that an author opens a new application form and finds the
/// ordinary questions already written rather than an empty page.
/// <para>
/// The set and its wording came from MLH's affiliation requirements, which is
/// why the keys and columns are shaped the way they are and why the two
/// agreements are worded so precisely. That obligation is now the registration
/// team's to keep rather than this code's to impose.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The two agreements store timestamps rather than booleans. "They agreed" is
/// weaker evidence than "they agreed at 14:03 on the 12th, against form version
/// 3", and this is a legal agreement we may have to show.
