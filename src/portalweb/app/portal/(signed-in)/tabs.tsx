 * The five screens, and the way out.
 *
 * Check in is shown to everybody rather than only to people who have a code.
 * A tab that appeared the day somebody confirmed would tell them that day what
 * they were supposed to be told by an email, and the screen behind it explains
 * itself for anyone who is not there yet.
 *
 * Announcements sits second, next to the screen everybody lands on, because it
 * is the only tab here whose contents change while somebody is standing in the
 * building. The other three are answers to questions asked once. It is shown
 * to everybody for the same reason check in is: a tab that appeared the first
 * time something was posted would be a notification, and a notification is
 * exactly the thing this feature is not.
 *
 * A client component only because the current tab has to be marked, and
 * `usePathname` is the only way to know which one that is. `aria-current` does
 * the marking; the underline is the visual echo of it, not the other way
 * round, so a screen reader gets the same answer as a sighted reader.
