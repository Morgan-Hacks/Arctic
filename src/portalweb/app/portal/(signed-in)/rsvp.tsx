/**
 * Taking a spot, or giving it back.
 *
 * The one screen in this portal where somebody does something consequential,
 * so it is built around the two ways it goes wrong. Confirming is the thing
 * they came to do and gets the accent and the whole width. Declining is quiet,
 * sits below, and asks a second time, because it releases the spot and the
 * lifecycle has no route back from it: an application that declines is
 * terminal, and the place has gone to the next person on the waitlist by the
 * time anybody notices the mistake.
 *
 * Nothing here is a gate. The API refuses a confirm that is out of time or out
 * of status whatever this renders, so `open` is a courtesy — the same
 * relationship the profile form has with `editable`. What this component owes
 * the applicant is not enforcement; it is knowing which of the two they are
 * about to do, and by when.
 *
 * @param rsvp Whether there is anything to answer, and the deadline if so.
 * @param deadline The deadline already rendered in the event's zone, or null.
 *   Formatted on the server so one date cannot be shown two ways, and so the
 *   markup the browser receives is the markup it keeps.
