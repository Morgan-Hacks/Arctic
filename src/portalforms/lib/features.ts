 * works in a server component or a route handler and does not work in the
 * browser: Next replaces `process.env.SOMETHING` in client bundles by matching
 * the literal text, so a computed lookup finds an empty object there and every
 * flag would read as its file default no matter what the environment says.
 * Importing this into a "use client" file is the one way to get that wrong.
 *
 * features.json holds the default, and an environment variable of the same name
 * upper-cased overrides it -- the same arrangement the .NET services use, with
 * the same key names, so a flag can be found by searching for one string across
 * the whole repository.
