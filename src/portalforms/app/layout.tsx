/**
 * The reading face, behind enable_reading_mode_feature.
 *
 * OpenDyslexic from @fontsource/opendyslexic — SIL OFL 1.1, which permits web
 * distribution, so it is self-hosted from npm rather than committed here. Next
 * hashes and serves it, so no CDN is involved.
 *
 * Regular and bold only; no italic, because nothing in reading mode sets any.
 *
 * `preload: false`, because the flag is off by default and preloading a face
 * almost nobody uses would cost every applicant a request. The application form
 * is the longest stretch of reading an applicant does in this system, which is
 * the reason this app reads the flag at all.
